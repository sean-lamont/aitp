## Update 1/8/23
### Update
- Managed to get LeanStep and LeanGym to output S-Expressions in a similar way to HOList
- Another paper (INT) with a synthetic environment, similar to Equations, in process of integrating (nearly done)
- Running small scale (5 step) TacticZero Experiments, might be able to leave a large run in background but at least 
get some results with this
- HOList
  - Running several experiments in parallel 
  - Tried testing out evaluation loop: Takes a *very* long time, about 7-8 minutes for a single proof 
  which is the timeout they used in their evaluation, over 3000+ proofs.
  - Managed to get their distributed code running over local threads (with Apache Beam)
- Added Hydra for configuration management, makes only minimal changes necessary for running complex experiments
  - Used this to setup hyperparameter sweeps
- Implemented Ensemble model and integrated into framework.
 Currently running sweep over some values to see if it helps anything
- Writing paper.

### TODO

- Lot of writing, main uncertainty is how to present and evaluate the framework
- Add INT and Lean, and experiments if there is time
